                                                   # TWO PASS ASSEMBLER


PROBLEM STATEMENT

Write a two-pass assembler for the 12-bit accumulator architecture

SOLUTION

In this project, we have designed an implementation of a two-pass assembler.
The assembler takes a text file as an input. The text file contains the assembly code. 
The assembler translates this assembly code into machine code and saves it as a separate text file.

Programming Language: Java

Developers: Piyush Sharma and Vani Sikka
